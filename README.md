# Heart Disease Prediction Data Analysis

## Overview
This is a project on heart disease prediction dataset. We will perfom data analysis then we shall build models such as logistic regression and decision trees by splitting data into training and test sets. The essence of this process is obtain predictions from our models. 

## Business Understanding
I have chosen a heart disease prediction dataset, my stakeholder is a hospital administrator. We would like to predict the likelihood of a patient having a heart disease based on their medical history and other factors. In order to help the hospital administrator make informed decisions about resource allocation and patient care.

A classification problem in data science is a type of supervised learning problem where the goal is to predict a categorical label or class that an instance belongs to, based on its features or characteristics.

## Data understanding and Data Analysis
The data used in this analysis contains data collected from the dataset: Heart disease-prediction. A heart disease prediction dataset typically consists of various features related to patient characterisctics and medical history. These features can include age, sex, blood pressure, cholestorol levels, smoking habits and other relevant factors. The dataset may also contain a target variable indicating whether the patient has a heart disease or not.
